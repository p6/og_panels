This module enables you to configure a default node for OG Panels.

The default nid can be set at admin/og/og_panels/defaults

Panel pages will be cloned per node on creation or save.

(If you're facing problems, pass sync='TRUE' in the node URL, so that the template node panels are recloned afresh)
